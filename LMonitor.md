#          20 Command Line Tools to Monitor Linux Performance


### 1. Top – Linux Process Monitoring


Linux Top command is a performance monitoring program that is used frequently by many system administrators to monitor Linux performance and it is available under many Linux/Unix-like operating systems.

The top command is used to display all the running and active real-time processes in an ordered list and updates it regularly. It displays CPU usage, Memory usage, Swap Memory, Cache Size, Buffer Size, Process PID, User, Commands, and much more.

It also shows high memory and cpu utilization of running processes. The top command is much useful for system administrators to monitor and take corrective action when required. Let’s see the top command in action.


#### 2. VmStat – Virtual Memory Statistics

Linux VmStat command is used to display statistics of virtual memory, kernel threads, disks, system processes, I/O blocks, interrupts, CPU activity, and much more.

Install VmStat in Linux
By default vmstat command is not available under Linux systems you need to install a package called sysstat (a powerful monitoring tool) that includes a vmstat program.

$ sudo yum install sysstat      [On Older CentOS/RHEL & Fedora]
$ sudo dnf install sysstat      [On CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Rocky Linux & AlmaLinux]

$ sudo pacman -S sysstat        [On Arch Linux]
The common usage of vmstat command format is.

# vmstat



#### 3. Lsof – List Open Files

The lsof command is used in many Linux/Unix-like systems to display a list of all the open files and the processes. The open files included are disk files, network sockets, pipes, devices, and processes.

One of the main reasons for using this command is when a disk cannot be unmounted and displays the error that files are being used or opened. With this command, you can easily identify which files are in use.

The most common format for lsof command is.

# lsof

#### 4. Tcpdump – Network Packet Analyzer

The tcpdump command is one of the most widely used command-line network packet analyzer or packets sniffer programs that is used to capture or filters TCP/IP packets that are received or transferred on a specific interface over a network.

$ sudo pacman -S iotop        [On Arch Linux]
The common usage of iotop command format is.

# iotop

#### 8. Iostat – Input/Output Statistics

iostat is a simple tool that will collect and show system input and output storage device statistics. This tool is often used to trace storage device performance issues including devices, local disks, remote disks such as NFS.

Install Iostat in Linux
To get the iostat command, you need to install a package called sysstat as shown.

$ sudo yum install sysstat      [On Older CentOS/RHEL & Fedora]
$ sudo dnf install sysstat      [On CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Rocky Linux & AlmaLinux]
$ sudo apt-get install sysstat  [On Debian/Ubuntu & Mint]
$ sudo pacman -S sysstat        [On Arch Linux]
The common usage of iostat command format is.

# iostat


#### 9. IPTraf – Real-Time IP LAN Monitoring

IPTraf is an open-source console-based real-time network (IP LAN) monitoring utility for Linux. It collects a variety of information such as 

IP traffic monitor that passes over the network, including TCP flag information, ICMP details, TCP/UDP traffic breakdowns, TCP connection packet, and byte counts.

It also gathers information of general and detailed interface statistics of TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, non-IP, IP checksum errors, interface activity, etc.


#### 10. Psacct or Acct – Monitor User Activity

psacct or acct tools are very useful for monitoring each user’s activity on the system. Both daemons run in the background and keep a close watch on the overall activity of each user on the system and also what resources are being consumed by them.

These tools are very useful for system administrators to track each user’s activity like what they are doing, what commands they issued, how much resources are used by them, how long they are active on the system etc.


#### 11. Monit – Linux Process and Services Monitoring

Monit is a free open source and web-based process supervision utility that automatically monitors and manages system processes, programs, files, directories, permissions, checksums, and filesystems.

It monitors services like Apache, MySQL, Mail, FTP, ProFTP, Nginx, SSH, and so on. The system status can be viewed from the command line or using its own web interface.
